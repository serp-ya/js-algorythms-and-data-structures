# Linked list

In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. 
Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. 
In its most basic form, each node contains: data, and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. 

This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration.
