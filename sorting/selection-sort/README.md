# Selection sort

One of the popular algorithms for sorting a sequence of numbers.

The essence of the algorithm is that it uses the linear search of the smallest value in the array, then changes it with the leftmost element if it is not itself the leftmost element.

The operation is repeated for each element of the array, after which the array is considered sorted.
