# Bubble sort

One of the popular algorithms for sorting a sequence of numbers.

The algorithm sequentially compares two next-standing numbers and goes from the end to the beginning of the array.

If the left number is less than the right number, then they change places.

After one full cycle on the left, there will be the smallest number and it is considered fully sorted.

The algorithm repeats the operation until all the values in the sequence are considered completely sorted.
