# Insertion sort

One of the popular algorithms for sorting a sequence of numbers.

The algorithm considers that the first element is sorted. After that, he takes the leftmost element and starts comparing it in order with those elements that are sorted.

If the left element is smaller than the element that we are checking, then they are interchanged. 

This continues until the left element is smaller than the one we are testing or until the left edge of the array is reached.
